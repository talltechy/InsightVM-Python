## To update the `requirements.txt` file for a Python project, follow these steps

1. Activate your virtual environment (if applicable).
2. Install the required packages for your project by running the following command:  

   ```bash
   pip install <package_name>
   ```

   Replace `<package_name>` with the name of the package you want to install.
3. After installing all the necessary packages, run the following command to generate the updated `requirements.txt` file:  

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

4. The above command will overwrite the existing `requirements.txt` file with the updated list of packages and their versions.

Make sure to commit and push the updated `requirements.txt` file to your version control system so that others can use the same packages as you.
